 # :green_apple: ScholarUp Case Study
This case study documents the development process, from initial problem analysis to the final deliverable, highlighting key milestones, stakeholder feedback, and iterative improvements.

## Milestone 2: Problem Analysis and Project Proposal
### Problem Statement
Students struggle with organization, motivation, and consistency in their study habits. Existing apps like Notion, Duolingo, and Quizlet offer partial solutions but lack a unified approach that combines planning, studying, and social accountability.

### Solution: ScholarUp
ScholarUp addresses these challenges by integrating:
- **Study Tools** (Flashcards, Test Maker, Study Timer, Note Imports)
- **Planning** (Task Management, Habit Tracking, Syllabus Integration)
- **Social & Gamification** (Leaderboards, Achievements)

### Stakeholders
1. **Procrastinators** â€“ Need structure and reminders.
2. **Overachievers** â€“ Thrive on competition and achievements.
3. **Freshmen/Transfer Students** â€“ Require guidance and organization.
4. **Non-Traditional Students** â€“ Need accessibility and ease of use.
5. **Students Struggling with Burnout** â€“ Benefit from mindfulness and habit tracking.

### Competitive Analysis
| App | Strengths | Weaknesses |
| ---         |     ---      |          --- |
| Notion   | Organization, Scalability     | Steep learning curve, Poor mobile UX    |
| Duolingo     | Gamification, Addictive       | Aggressive ads, Punitive mistakes      |
| Quizlet     | Study Modes, Offline Access       | Paywalled features, Disorganized imports      |

## Milestone 3: Competitive Analysis
### Inspiration from Existing Apps
1. **Duolingo** â€“ Leaderboards, XP system, addictive UX.

  - **Adopted**: Gamification (but with an opt-out for non-competitive users).
  - **Changed**: Added messaging and customizable themes.

2. **Notion** â€“ Organizational flexibility, templates.
  - **Adopted**: Guided onboarding with tooltips.
  - **Changed**: More intuitive UI with a zen-inspired color scheme.

3. Flora â€“ Study timer with gamified breaks.
  - **Adopted**: Focus timer with breaks.
  - **Changed**: Added doodle feature during breaks for stress relief.

### Conclusion
ScholarUp stands out by merging multiple study tools into one cohesive experience, unlike competitors that focus on single functionalities.

## Milestone 6: Paper Prototype Testing
### Testing Observations
| Issue  | Solution Implemented |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Unclear navigation icons  | Replaced with labeled sidebar  |

- Task visibility was unclear â†’ **Improved calendar UI**.
- Users loved the color scheme.
- We also observed that students doodle on the white boards, concluding that we also need a doodle feature.
