# 🍏 About ScholarUp

ScholarUp is a **study companion** designed with students in mind. Born from the frustration of juggling multiple apps for studying, planning, and staying motivated, ScholarUp brings everything together in one beautifully cohesive experience.

### The Problem

Students today face:
- **App Fatigue** — Switching between Quizlet, Notion, Flora, and other apps
- **Lack of Motivation** — No rewards or visual progress tracking
- **Poor Organization** — Tasks scattered across different platforms
- **Burnout** — No built-in breaks or stress relief features

### The Solution

ScholarUp addresses these challenges by providing:
- **All-in-One Study Tools** — Flashcards, timers, and task management
- **Aesthetic Design** — A calming, zen-inspired color scheme
- **Gamification** — Track progress, earn stats, and stay motivated
- **Break Time Features** — Doodle during breaks to relieve stress

# 🍏 Case Study

This case study documents the development process, from initial problem analysis to the final deliverable, highlighting key milestones, stakeholder feedback, and iterative improvements.

## Problem Analysis

#### The Challenge
Students struggle with organization, motivation, and consistency in their study habits. Existing apps offer partial solutions but lack a unified approach.

#### Target Users (Stakeholders)

| User Type | Pain Points | What They Need |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Procrastinators** | Hard to start tasks | Streaks, reminders, accountability |
| **Overachievers** | Need motivation | Competition, achievements, stats |
| **Freshmen** | Disorganized | Simple onboarding, clear UI |
| **Non-Traditional** | Tech learning curve | Intuitive design, tutorials |
| **Burnt-Out Students** | Overwhelmed | Breaks, mindfulness |

#### Competitive Analysis

| App | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----|-----------|------------|
| **Notion** | Organization, flexibility | Steep learning curve, poor mobile UX |
| **Duolingo** | Gamification, addictive | Aggressive ads, punitive mistakes |
| **Quizlet** | Study modes, offline | Paywalled features, messy imports |
| **Flora** | Focus timer, gamified | Limited features, no flashcards |

#### Learned & Adopted

| From | Adopted | Improved |
|------|---------|----------|
| Duolingo | Gamification, stats tracking | Opt-out for non-competitive users |
| Notion | Organizational flexibility | More intuitive UI, easy onboarding |
| Flora | Focus timer with breaks | Added doodle feature for stress relief |
| Quizlet | Flashcard functionality | Cleaner UI, image support, free features |

## User Research

#### Testing Findings & Iterations

| Issue Found | Solution Implemented |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Unclear navigation icons | Changed icons to be more clear |
| Task visibility unclear | Improved calendar UI with date indicators |
| Back buttons too small | Made larger and more visible |
| Users doodle when bored | Added doodle feature during breaks |

#### Examples of doodles we saw at the library where the user tests took place:

## Database Schema

### Entity Relationship Diagram

### Security Model

All tables implement **Row Level Security (RLS)**:

```sql
-- Example: Users can only access their own data
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their own data"
ON table_name FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

This ensures:
- Users can only read their own data
- Users can only modify their own data
- No cross-user data leakage
- Safe to use public API keys
